Main engine: Godot → light, ARM-friendly, open-source, flexible.

Core language: C++ (engine parts, performance-critical code).

Scripting/gameplay: GDScript (easy) or Lua.

Graphics: GLSL shaders → essential for lighting, atmosphere, post-processing.

Optional: Use Rust for safer modules or tools.

This way you get a workflow like:

Prototype in Godot (GDScript).

Optimize engine/world in C++.

Write shaders in GLSL for visuals.

Test everything directly on J10 at lower settings.
